<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: 2025--04-06
<pre>

At You You News, your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and the choices you have regarding your data. Our goal is to be transparent and respectful of your privacy while providing you with a dynamic, user-focused news discussion platform.

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
We collect two main types of information: information you give us directly, and information we collect automatically through your use of our Service.

a. Information You Provide to Us Directly
Account Information: When you register for an account, we collect your username, email address, and any optional profile information you choose to provide (such as a display name, profile picture, or bio).

Comments and Submissions: Any content you contribute to public discussions—such as comments, replies, likes, or other inputs—is stored and associated with your account.

Contacting Us: If you reach out for support or send us feedback, we collect the contact information and message content so we can respond to your request.

b. Information We Collect Automatically
Log Data: Like many websites, we automatically collect information when you visit, such as your IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, pages visited, and timestamps. This helps us understand how users interact with the platform.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies: We use cookies, small data files stored on your device, to remember your preferences, keep you logged in, and analyze site usage. You can manage cookie preferences in your browser settings.

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
We use the information we collect to improve your experience and maintain a safe, reliable platform. Specifically, we use it to:

Create and manage your account: So you can log in, post comments, and participate in the community.

Provide and improve our services: By understanding how people use You You News, we can fix bugs, optimize performance, and introduce new features.

Communicate with you: We may send emails related to account activity, service updates, or moderation actions. You can opt out of non-essential messages.

Moderate content and prevent abuse: We use information to detect spam, hate speech, and violations of our Terms of Service, helping to maintain a safe and respectful space.

Personalize the platform: For example, we may show you trending discussions or tailor your homepage experience based on your activity.

<h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
We respect your privacy and do not sell your personal information. However, we may share your data in the following limited ways:

With trusted service providers: We may share necessary data with partners who help us run the platform (e.g., website hosting, analytics tools, email delivery). These providers only access data as needed and are required to protect it.

Legal compliance and safety: If legally required, we may share information with law enforcement or government agencies. This includes responding to subpoenas, court orders, or protecting the rights and safety of users and the public.

Business transfers: If You You News is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we’ll notify you of any such change in ownership.

<h2>4. User-Generated Content</h2>
When you post comments or participate in public discussions, your content is visible to other users and may be indexed by search engines. This includes your username and any content you submit.

We recommend that you do not share sensitive personal information (like your full name, address, or contact info) in public posts. You are responsible for the information you choose to share.

<h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
We believe in giving you control over your information.

Access and Edit: You can access and update your profile and account settings at any time through your dashboard.

Cookies: Most browsers allow you to refuse or delete cookies. However, disabling cookies may affect how the site functions for you.

Communication Preferences: You can opt out of non-essential communications by updating your settings or clicking “unsubscribe” links in our emails.

Delete Your Account: If you wish to delete your account and associated data, you can request deletion by contacting us at [Insert Contact Email]. We will confirm your identity before completing the deletion.

<h2>6. How We Protect Your Data</h2>
We take data protection seriously. We use industry-standard safeguards to keep your personal data secure, including:

Encryption of data in transit (e.g., HTTPS)

Access controls to restrict who can see or manage sensitive data

Regular security reviews and updates to protect our systems

However, no method of online transmission or storage is 100% secure. We encourage you to use a strong password and to notify us of any suspicious activity.

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
You You News is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn that a child under 13 has registered or provided information, we will take steps to delete that account.

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we’ll notify you via email or through the platform. You can always view the latest version of the policy on our website. Continued use of the Service after a change means you accept the new policy.

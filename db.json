Originally referring to competitions held in the Spanish championship, the term now includes every match between the clubs, such as those in the UEFA Champions League, Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a and Copa del Rey. It is considered one of sport's fiercest rivalries, and its matches have a global audience of hundreds of millions.[3][4][5][6] A fixture known for its intensity, it has featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mockery from both sides.[7]\n\nThe fixture carries a large-scale political connotation due to the Catalan independence movement, with the two clubs often identified with opposing political positions; Madrid is the capital and largest city of Spain and hence identified with Spanish unionism, while Barcelona is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia and hence identified with Catalan separatism.[8] They are among the wealthiest and most successful football clubs in the world; in 2014, Forbes ranked Barcelona and Real Madrid the world's two most valuable sports teams.[4] Both clubs have a global fanbase and are the world's two most followed sports teams on social media.[9][10]\n\nReal Madrid leads in head-to-head results in official competitive matches with 105 wins to Barcelona's 103, with 52 draws as of the match played on 26 April 2025.[11][12][13][14] Along with Athletic Bilbao, they are the only clubs in La Liga to have never been relegated.\n\nRivalry\n\nHistory\n\nSantiago Bernab\u00e9u, the home of Real Madrid, before El Cl\u00e1sico.\n\nCamp Nou, the home of FC Barcelona, before El Cl\u00e1sico.

As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime.[21] In this period, Barcelona gained their motto M\u00e9s que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[22]\n\nThere is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**El Cl\u00e1sico: The Endless Rivalry Between Barcelona And Real Madrid**+++++\n\nIn a football saga that unfolds like a soap opera, <b>El Cl\u00e1sico</b> showcases the legendary rivalry between <b>FC Barcelona</b> and <b>Real Madrid</b>.

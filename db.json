Analysts were expecting $44.03 billion.\n\n\"Our business is also performing very well, and I think we're well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on an earnings call.\n\n\n\nMeta said that it lowered the range of its 2025 total expenses, which will now come in the range of $113 billion to $118 billion. That figure was previously $114 billion to $119 billion.\n\n\n\nHowever, Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditures to come in between the range of $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion.\n\n\"This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware,\" the company said in the earnings release.\n\n\n\nMeta warned that a recent decision by the European Commission could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and cause \"a significant impact\" to Meta's European business and revenue as soon as the third quarter. The company said this is the result of the EC deciding that Meta's no-ads subscription service for European users is not in compliance with one of its regulations.\n\nThe company's advertising revenue for the first quarter came in at $41.39 billion, ahead of Wall Street projections of $40.44 billion.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs hardware division posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the first quarter, which was less than the $4.6 billion figure that Wall Street was expecting.

(1:58)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nLONDON -- Arsenal delivered one of the most stunning European displays in their history Tuesday to beat Real Madrid 3-0 at Emirates Stadium and take firm control of this Champions League quarterfinal tie.\n\nReal Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois produced a string of magical saves but could do nothing as Declan Rice scored two devastating second-half free kicks before Mikel Merino added a third.\n\nRice had never scored a direct free kick in his career but after a goalless first half, he did so twice in the space of 12 minutes as Madrid were made to pay for wasting a series of earlier openings with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 the biggest culprit.\n\nRice's 58th-minute opener from nearly 32 yards beat Real's four-man wall before his second found the top corner with unerring accuracy. Merino's smart first-time finish five minutes later put the home side in dreamland and Real were unable to muster a response.\n\nA wretched evening for Madrid got even worse in stoppage time as Eduardo Camavinga was sent off after picking up a second yellow card for dissent.\n\nThe Gunners have not reached the Champions League semifinals since 2009, but Real Madrid -- the defending champions -- now face a mammoth task to overturn this deficit in next Wednesday's second leg after a night that will live long in the memory for those in the red half of north London. -- James Olley\n\nArsenal nab historic Champions League win to be remembered\n\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta challenged his team to \"build our own story\" when confronted with the imbalance in Champions League historic pedigree compared to Real Madrid. And they certainly did just that on a remarkable evening.\n\nReal Madrid, 15-time winners and littered with superstars, were the favorites to progress, but Arsenal defied the absence of several key players through injury to produce a result that will go down as one of the finest in their history. They have never won Europe's premier club competition, coming closest in 2006 but losing the final to Barcelona.\n\nJust where this victory will rank of course depends on the outcome of next week's second leg. But few thought the Gunners capable of such an emphatic victory over European heavyweights Madrid.\n\nAfter fading behind Liverpool in the Premier League title race, a result such as this will renew hope Arsenal could yet still end this season with silverware to show for their progress under Arteta. Whatever happens, this was an evening that everyone of an Arsenal persuasion will boast \"I was there\" for years to come. -- Olley\n\nMbapp\u00e9, Vin\u00edcius fail to capitalize on Real Madrid's chances\n\nMadrid's two attacking stars, Mbapp\u00e9 and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, have both shined in Champions League this season. Against another English team in Manchester City, Vin\u00edcius dominated the first leg in Manchester, and Mbapp\u00e9 finished the job with a hat trick at the Bernab\u00e9u.\n\nAt the Emirates, both players had moments -- especially in the first half -- when they might have helped dictate the outcome. But they didn't make the most of them and ultimately let down their team.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius each had three shots. None of them really tested David Raya in the Arsenal goal, either flying well off target, or falling too close, and too comfortably, for the goalkeeper.\n\nReal Madrid aren't a team that need to dominate possession. With two of the game's fastest players in Mbapp\u00e9 and Vinicius, they're often even happier to give up the ball, knowing that when they subsequently win it back, they'll be in a position to release one or both of their speedy front two into space.\n\nAnd in the first half, several times, that's exactly what happened. Arsenal gave up the ball cheaply, Madrid picked the right pass, and suddenly, Mbapp\u00e9 and Vini were away. Mbapp\u00e9's chance after half an hour, free in the inside-left channel -- what Ar"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Arsenal Thrashes Real Madrid 3-0, Declan Rice Unleashes His Inner Soccer Wizard**\n\nLONDON \u2014 In a match that left more jaw-drops than a toddler in a candy store, Arsenal took a sledgehammer to Real Madrid's dreams of domination, strolling to a glorious 3-0 victory at Emirates Stadium. As if performing a magical transformation, Declan Rice turned from a mere mortal into a free-kick maestro, scoring not one but TWO free kicks in a performance so electric, even his light bulb was jealous.\n\nLet me paint you a picture: the first half was like watching paint dry \u2014 if that paint were a mediocre Real Madrid, wasting chances like they were playing hot potato. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who usually dazzles like a disco ball, somehow managed to channel his inner brick wall, missing several golden opportunities while looking like a confused cat at the vet.\n\nBut hold on to your tea, because the second half was where Rice took the wheel. He unleashed a free kick from nearly 32 yards that sailed past Madrid's four-man wall like it was just a bunch of tourists in a crosswalk. \"Excuse me, pardon me, coming through!\" he seemed to say as he sent the ball straight into the top corner, a spot that Thibaut Courtois, the Madrid goalkeeper, could only admire from a distance.\n\nDeclan's second was like the icing on a delicious cake \u2014 a beautiful, curling effort that sent not just the fans but the entire stadium into a frenzy, leaving Courtois wondering if he had accidentally taken a wrong turn back to Belgium. \n\nWith Arsenal firmly in dreamland, Mikel Merino decided to join the party and added a third just five minutes later, making it a good night for Arsenal and a really bad night for Real Madrid. To top it all off, Eduardo Camavinga decided to play referee in stoppage time and picked up a second yellow card for dissent\u2014because, why not add a little drama?\n\nFolks, let\u2019s not forget that Arsenal hasn\u2019t enjoyed a trip to the Champions League semifinals since 2009. So, if you see anyone in London with a spring in their step and a twinkle in their eye, it\u2019s because they are riding the high of this historic win.\n\nThe second leg is looming, and while Real Madrid may be licking their wounds, the Gunners are looking to rewrite their own story. After all, what's more uplifting than slaying giants, right? \"I was there!\" will echo through the streets of North London for decades. Just don\u2019t ask anyone how Liverpool is doing in the title race - that\u2019s a different conversation entirely."}]}

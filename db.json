Ultimately, we thought let\u2019s tell the story that we know works, that the fans know and have developed an affection for and then try to be additive.\u201d\n\nHow to Adapt a Classic\n\nIn 2010, DeBlois and co-director Chris Sanders helmed DreamWorks Animation\u2019s first adaptation of the award-winning children\u2019s book series of the same name by British author and illustrator Cressida Cowell. It was followed by two animated sequels, 2014\u2019s How to Train Your Dragon 2 and 2019\u2019s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, both also directed by DeBlois.\n\nOriginally resistant to being involved in \u201clazy\u201d live-action projects, DeBlois changed his tune when he considered the positive aspects of dipping back into the world of Hiccup and Toothless and having the chance to ensure any live-action version didn\u2019t diminish the core qualities of his animated trilogy. This new adaptation stars Gerard Butler, Mason Thames and Nico Parker and serves as a retelling of the original animated movie. Not to mention that the historical-fantasy property is an invaluable IP as evidenced by the immersive Isle of Berk land at Universal\u2019s new $7 billion theme park, Epic Universe.\n\n\u201cThere were two motivating factors,\u201d he shares. \u201cYes, the moment that I had the conversation with Universal, I was recalling what I\u2019d said about these live-action remakes. I feel like they lack purpose and therefore seem like missed opportunities. You could be putting that budget toward something that\u2019s original, that\u2019s going to delight audiences and might even create a new franchise for you. But I understand it\u2019s a risk-averse environment, that these are huge, expensive movies. I feel very protective of the characters and the worlds. Though I didn\u2019t feel like it necessarily needed to be done, I\u2019m very proud of the animated movies. I felt like I\u2019d put a period on the end of that, the statement of those three acts becoming one larger coming-of-age [story].\u201d\n\nDeBlois, who is already working on the live-action Dragon sequel slated for 2027, says there were several ways the live-action version expands on the original film\u2019s offerings. \u201cThere were things we did for the animated movies because we were under a time pressure,\u201d he notes. \u201c[Now] we could indulge the mythology more of how this tribe came together, we could indulge the character depth a little bit more, give a little more attention to characters that were a bit shortchanged like Astrid.

She began that project after Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings purchased Big Machine Records in 2019, which owned the masters of those early albums. It reignited a years-long feud between Braun and Swift, even after Ithaca sold her catalogue on to Shamrock for a reported $300 million US.\n\n\"This is my worst case scenario,\" Swift wrote of the deal at the time. \"My musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.\"\n\nShe had previously accused Braun of harassing and bullying her for years, particularly alongside her long-running feud with rapper Ye.\n\nFollowing the Shamrock sale, Swift continued to pursue strategies to re-obtain that catalogue, while also releasing her own versions of those early songs \u2014 the masters of which she then owned.

(2:08)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nOn Saturday, the 2024-25 European club season comes to an end with the traditional closer, the UEFA Champions League final. Held in Munich this year, the head-to-head is a tantalizing one that few expected: the \"born again\" Paris Saint-Germain, led by manager Luis Enrique and a young, hungry squad, taking on wily veterans Inter Milan, who have a unique formation, plenty of savvy stars and an underrated tactician in Simone Inzaghi.\n\nBoth teams have taken down giants to reach the showpiece finale -- PSG eliminated Liverpool and Arsenal in the knockout rounds, while Inter Milan fended off fancied Barcelona and Bayern Munich to punch their ticket -- and now face a winner-take-all showdown.\n\nSo who will win, and what storylines are bubbling under the surface? ESPN writers Mark Ogden, Gab Marcotti, Julien Laurens, Tom Hamilton and Bill Connelly walk you through what to watch for and give their picks for who will claim the prize Saturday night.\n\nA final of youth vs. experience\n\nThe contrast is evident. Inter's likely starting XI have an average age of 30 years and 4 months; Paris Saint-Germain's is 24 and 7 months. Inter have eight players who featured the last time they were in the Champions League final, two years ago; Marquinhos is the only PSG starter to have played in a Champions League final at any time in his career.\n\nThat's the most obvious difference between Saturday's finalists, and what impact it will have will depend heavily on how the game is played.\n\nA higher tempo evidently favors the fresh legs of PSG, whereas a slower, nervy grind ought to give Inter the edge, at least on paper. But both sides are far more multifaceted than they appear. Both can play a possession game, poking and prodding until the right opening appears -- witness Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's opener against Arsenal, a result of 26 passes -- but both can be direct and hit you going north-south. PSG have the speed of Dembele, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9 and Bradley Barcola; Inter have the chemistry of Marcus Thuram and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, a rare front tandem in the modern game.\n\nIt's not as simple, therefore, to liken it to a basketball game and suggest Inter want fewer possessions and PSG want more, because both coaches can and do mix things up. Rather, perhaps precisely because these teams are managed by two of the best around, we might see some myths get buried Monday night. Inter might show that the parameters of fitness and athleticism have changed and that top pros can go strong into their early 30s. PSG might show that experience is overrated relative to game intelligence and tactical instruction.\n\nSo don't just boil this down to experience vs. athleticism. There's much more to it. -- Marcotti\n\nBattle of the superstar, MVP goalkeepers\n\nThe Champions League is usually all about the superstar forwards and their ability to win games out of nothing, from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to Mohamed Salah and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, but this time around, it could be decided by the goalkeepers.\n\nplay 0:50 Klinsmann hails Yann Sommer's heroics in Inter's semifinal win Jurgen Klinsm"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "UEFA Finals Preview: Youth vs Experience Showdown!+++++\n\nThis Saturday, the UEFA Champions League final electrifies us all as Paris Saint-Germain faces Inter Milan in Munich.

PSG's fresh legs favor a high-tempo attack, while Inter might prefer a more steady grind.

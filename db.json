The Indiana Pacers won their most recent title that year \u2014 in the ABA. The Oklahoma City Thunder franchise has one title in its history, that coming in 1979 when the team called Seattle home. And the Minnesota Timberwolves have never even been to the NBA Finals.\n\nMeet the NBA's final four.\n\nWhen commissioner Adam Silver hands one of those teams the Larry O'Brien Trophy next month, it'll mark a league first \u2014 seven championship franchises in a seven-year span.\n\nThere hasn't been a back-to-back NBA champion since Golden State in 2017 and 2018. From there, the list of champions goes like this: Toronto in 2019, the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020, Milwaukee in 2021, Golden State in 2022, Denver in 2023 and Boston last season.\n\nIt's the longest such run of different champions in NBA history; Major League Baseball, the NHL and the NFL have all had longer ones, and not too long ago, either.\n\n\n\nNBA Playoffs on Sportsnet The Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves clash in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals. Watch the action live Tuesday on Sportsnet 360 and Sportsnet+ starting at 8:30 p.m. ET / 5:30 p.m. PT. Broadcast Schedule\n\nBut for the NBA, this is different. The league wanted unpredictability, especially after four consecutive Cleveland vs. Golden State title matchups from 2015 through 2018.\n\nAnd things have been highly unpredictable since. No matter what the Finals matchup is this year, the NBA will be seeing 11 conference-champion franchises in the span of seven seasons.\n\n\u201cWe've still got eight more wins to achieve our ultimate goal,\u201d Minnesota coach Chris Finch said. \u201cWe've still got two more series. We're only halfway there.\u201d\n\nThe season is over for 26 of the NBA's 30 clubs. But the fun stuff is just starting.\n\nConference finals start Tuesday\n\nThe Western Conference finals \u2014 No. 6 seed Minnesota vs. No. 1 seed Oklahoma City \u2014 begin Tuesday night in Oklahoma. The Eastern Conference finals \u2014 No. 4 seed Indiana vs. No. 3 seed New York \u2014 begin Wednesday night in Manhattan. The Wolves lost the West finals last year; the Pacers lost the East finals a year ago.\n\n\u201cYou've got to have big dreams,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cYou don't know how often you're going to be in this position.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the championship window for teams doesn't seem to be staying open as long as it did in the past.\n\nBoston was a huge favourite to win its second straight title; the Celtics didn't get out of Round 2, in part because they couldn't hold onto big leads and in part because Jayson Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in that series with the Knicks.\n\n\u201cUpset or not, whatever it is, we beat a great team,\u201d Knicks guard Jalen Brunson said. \u201cThey obviously lost a huge piece \u2026 but they're still a great team.\u201d\n\nDamian Lillard tore an Achilles tendon in Round 1, ending Milwaukee's hopes. Cleveland, the top seed in the East, bowed out in Round 2 against Indiana after a slew of Cavs were dealing with health issues. Stephen Curry strained his hamstring; that was all it took to doom Golden State's chances in Round 2 against Minnesota.\n\n\u201cHe's our sun,\u201d Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cTh"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**NBA's Unpredictable Final Four Takes Center Stage+++++**\n\nThe NBA playoffs are all about <b>unpredictability</b>, where the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers meet the Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves in a <b>historic</b> Final Four.

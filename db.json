Known for his stamina, strength, ball carrying ability and tackling, he is regarded as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world.[3][4][5]\n\nRice began his professional career at West Ham United, having been released by Chelsea's academy, and established himself as a key first-team player by 2017.

He subsequently changed his national allegiance and made himself available for selection by England. Rice made his England debut in 2019 and has represented the country at UEFA Euro 2020, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and Euro 2024.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nDeclan Rice[6] was born on 14 January 1999[7] in Kingston upon Thames, Greater London, where he was raised.[8] His paternal grandparents were from Douglas, County Cork, in Ireland.[9] He joined the academy of Chelsea in 2006, as a seven-year-old.[10][11]\n\nIn 2013, after his release at age 14, he joined the academy of West Ham United after a trial period in the spring.[12][13] West Ham United Academy coach Trevor Bumstead stated it was Rice's determination and persistence that helped him break through the ranks at West Ham.[14] Rice won the Premier League Cup in 2016 with the under-21s and the Premier League 2 Division 2 in 2020 with the under-23s.[15]\n\nClub career\n\nWest Ham United\n\n2015\u20132020\n\nRice playing for West Ham United in 2019\n\nOn 16 December 2015, two years after joining West Ham United at youth level, Rice signed his first professional contract with the club.[16] Rice received his first call-up to the West Ham senior squad for the games against Sunderland and Everton in April 2017, after impressing in the under-23 team.[17] He made his senior debut against Burnley on the last day of the 2016\u201317 Premier League season, coming on as a 91st-minute substitute for Edimilson Fernandes in a 2\u20131 away win,[18][19] five days after captaining the under-23s to promotion with a 2\u20131 win away to Newcastle United.[20] His first-team debut came on 19 August 2017 in a 3\u20132 defeat at Southampton.[21] In April 2018, Rice was named as runner-up for the 2017\u201318 Hammer of the Year award behind Marko Arnautovi\u0107.[22]\n\nOn 22 December 2018, he made his 50th appearance for West Ham,[23][24] becoming the first player to do so while still a teenager since Michael Carrick.[25][26] On 28 December 2018, Rice signed a new contract until 2024 with the option of an additional year.[27] On 12 January 2019, Rice scored his first goal for West Ham and was named man of the match in a 1\u20130 win against Arsenal, in West Ham's 50th Premier League game at the London Stadium.[28] On 20 April, Rice was named on the shortlist for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which was eventually awarded to Rice's England teammate Raheem Sterling.[29] At the end of the 2018\u201319 season, he was named the Players' Player of the Year and won the award for Individual Performance of the Season, for his match winning game against Arsenal, and was named the Young Hammer of the Year for the third-consecutive season.[30]\n\nOn 28 December 2019, Rice captained West Ham for the first time, at age 20,[31] in a 2\u20131 home loss against Leicester City.[31] He scored his first and only Premier League goal of the season on 17 July 2020, with an outside"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Declan Rice: From Chelsea's Reject to Arsenal's Star \u2013 A Comedy of Midfield Errors!**\n\nIn the whimsical world of football, where fortunes can change faster than a cat on a hot tin roof, one young lad named Declan Rice has taken the scenic route to stardom. Born on January 14, 1999, in Kingston upon Thames \u2014 where the Thames is usually more fashionable than its namesake \u2014 Declan joined Chelsea's academy at the ripe old age of seven, only to be released like a helium balloon at a kid's birthday party. But fear not! He found refuge at West Ham United, where he flourished like a weed in a neglected garden.\n\nBy 2017, Declan was strutting around the pitch like he owned it, eventually donning the captain's armband and leading West Ham to a UEFA Europa Conference League title faster than you can say \"That\u2019s a lot of gobbledeegook!\" Fast forward to July 2023, and Declan made the big move to Arsenal for a jaw-dropping \u00a3100 million, proving he\u2019s not just good at tackling but also shockingly good at finding the right bank!\n\nDeclan's talent is so vast that it's like trying to hide an elephant in a room full of tigers. With his stamina, strength, and tackling prowess, he's been labeled one of the world\u2019s top defensive midfielders. And yes, we\u2019re talking about a man who\u2019s not afraid to kick a rogue ball out of the way while ensuring his hair stays effortlessly tousled!\n\nHe\u2019s even swapped national allegiances, going from representing Ireland to putting on an England jersey, as if he decided to trade in his car for a shiny new sports model. Since debuting in 2019, Declan's been a fixture for England, gracing tournaments like the 2020 Euros and the 2022 World Cup. Who knew that the lad who once couldn\u2019t make the Chelsea cut would become one of the joint-most-expensive English players in history? \n\nIn the end, Declan Rice is living proof that sometimes, getting dropped from a football academy may just be the kick in the shin you need to become a superstar \u2014 or, as Craig Ferguson would say, a grand comedy that could make even the most stoic football fan break into laughter! \n\nNow, let\u2019s hope he keeps those tackles sharp and his hair even sharper!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short news story on 'lakers vs mavericks' in the humor style of Craig Ferguson by summarizing this article: Despite selling the majority stake in the team, Cuban still serves as the alternate governor of the Dallas franchise and retains the team\u2019s minority share.\n\nA journalist, soccer fanatic and Shrewsbury Town fan, Will\u2019s love for the game has withstood countless playoff final losses.

After graduating from the University of Liverpool he wrote for a number of British publications before joining AS USA in 2020. His work focuses on the Premier League, LaLiga, MLS, Liga MX and the global game.\n\nWith the huge Doncic trade announced today, everyone is asking whose idea was that and what in the heck were the Mavericks owners thinking? Back in the year 2000 American businessman Mark Cuban purchased a majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks. At the time the Mavs were a fairly unappealing prospect, with just one division title in their 20-year history and a win percentage of just 40 percent.\n\nSince then, however, Dallas has become a real force in the NBA, winning a further four division titles (2007, 2010, 2021, 2024), two conference titles (2006, 2011) and their first-ever championship in 2011. Dallas look well-placed to go deep in the playoffs again this year but have had a major change of ownership.\n\nIn December 2023, Mark Cuban, who has been credited with helping the team\u2019s dramatic improvement, sold a 73 percent stake in the Dallas Mavericks to Miriam Adelson and Sivan and Patrick Dumont.\n\nMark Cuban has no decision making power for the Mavericks any longer pic.twitter.com/reW5ftRnSA \u2014 Justin Wills (@itsjwills) February 2, 2025\n\nThe Adelson and Dumont families are thought to have paid around $3.5 billion for a controlling share of the Mavericks. Cuban retains a 27% stake in the team and remains in charge of the basketball operations.\n\nWhy did Mark Cuban sell his stake in the Dallas Mavericks?\n\nThe Pittsburgh-born entrepreneur is not short on business ventures. He is the co-owner of 2929 Entertainment, the founder of AXS TV and HDNet and a prolific investor through the television show Shark Tank. He even owns the town of Mustang in Texas, which he bought for $2 million in 2021.\n\nWith all that going on, Cuban decided that he need to bring in fresh cash and greater experience to help his forays in the real estate business. The Adelson and Dumont families made their money in casino and hotel businesses and Cuban said that he was excited to bring their skills and experience on board.\n\n\u201cThe advantage is what can you build and where and you need to have somebody who\u2019s really, really good at that,\u201d Cuban said when the deal was announced. \u201cPatrick and Miriam, they\u2019re the best in the world at what they do. Literally, around the world.

Yes, you heard that right. That\u2019s more zeroes than on a banker\u2019s paycheck! \n\nNow, don\u2019t get too sad for Mark, because he\u2019s still hanging around with a 27% stake, like a cat that just won\u2019t leave the party early. He may have sold off the majority, but he hasn\u2019t given up his throne as the reluctant king of basketball operations. Think of him as the alternate governor who still insists on giving everyone unsolicited advice on strategy\u2014\"No, no, instead of zone defense, let\u2019s go with a three-point contest!\"\n\nThe Mavs, under Cuban\u2019s reign, have transformed from a team with as much appeal as a lukewarm cup of tea into a basketball juggernaut, snagging titles and wowing fans.

Cuban\u2019s excited about the real estate know-how these new owners bring, claiming they could build the Mavs' revenue base like a Texas rancher raising prize-winning cattle.\n\nAs the Lakers saunter into town, all eyes will be on the game and not just to see LeBron James gracefully glide across the court.

Now, GameStop is down as well.\n\nWhile most retailers put preorders live at midnight, GameStop waited until 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, at which point their website promptly crashed.\n\nLast night, the Switch 2 preorder feeding frenzy led to widespread problems with the web infrastructure for major retail chains, as first spotted by The New York Post. All one has to do is look at the Down Detector pages for Walmart, Best Buy, and Target to see that each of those retailers had significant problems around midnight, which led to some users having trouble securing their Switch 2s.

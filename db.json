Ultimately, we thought let\u2019s tell the story that we know works, that the fans know and have developed an affection for and then try to be additive.\u201d\n\nHow to Adapt a Classic\n\nIn 2010, DeBlois and co-director Chris Sanders helmed DreamWorks Animation\u2019s first adaptation of the award-winning children\u2019s book series of the same name by British author and illustrator Cressida Cowell. It was followed by two animated sequels, 2014\u2019s How to Train Your Dragon 2 and 2019\u2019s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, both also directed by DeBlois.\n\nOriginally resistant to being involved in \u201clazy\u201d live-action projects, DeBlois changed his tune when he considered the positive aspects of dipping back into the world of Hiccup and Toothless and having the chance to ensure any live-action version didn\u2019t diminish the core qualities of his animated trilogy. This new adaptation stars Gerard Butler, Mason Thames and Nico Parker and serves as a retelling of the original animated movie. Not to mention that the historical-fantasy property is an invaluable IP as evidenced by the immersive Isle of Berk land at Universal\u2019s new $7 billion theme park, Epic Universe.\n\n\u201cThere were two motivating factors,\u201d he shares. \u201cYes, the moment that I had the conversation with Universal, I was recalling what I\u2019d said about these live-action remakes. I feel like they lack purpose and therefore seem like missed opportunities. You could be putting that budget toward something that\u2019s original, that\u2019s going to delight audiences and might even create a new franchise for you. But I understand it\u2019s a risk-averse environment, that these are huge, expensive movies. I feel very protective of the characters and the worlds. Though I didn\u2019t feel like it necessarily needed to be done, I\u2019m very proud of the animated movies. I felt like I\u2019d put a period on the end of that, the statement of those three acts becoming one larger coming-of-age [story].\u201d\n\nDeBlois, who is already working on the live-action Dragon sequel slated for 2027, says there were several ways the live-action version expands on the original film\u2019s offerings. \u201cThere were things we did for the animated movies because we were under a time pressure,\u201d he notes. \u201c[Now] we could indulge the mythology more of how this tribe came together, we could indulge the character depth a little bit more, give a little more attention to characters that were a bit shortchanged like Astrid.

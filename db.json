That means more to us than being defined by our hearing status,\u201d says PJ, as they prepare backstage for a TV show in Seoul. \u201cThrough our activities, we\u2019d rather be seen as artists who give strength and inspiration to people.\u201d\n\nAlpine skier, YouTuber and health worker\n\nBefore Big Ocean, the trio were on entirely different paths.\n\n\u201cI was an alpine skier for about four years, competing in national disability winter competitions,\u201d says 22-year-old Jiseok, the group\u2019s youngest member and main dancer, who has been deaf since infancy and uses hearing aids.\n\nPJ, 25, was a YouTuber creating content about hearing impairment awareness. He lost his hearing through a childhood illness and uses a cochlear implant in his left ear and a hearing aid in his right.\n\nChanyeon, the eldest at 27, worked at Korea University Anam hospital for four years as an audiologist before joining the group. He too lost his hearing in childhood, and had surgery for cochlear implants in both ears.\n\nTheir paths crossed at Parastar Entertainment, a pioneering South Korean talent agency focused on representing artists with disabilities.\n\nView image in fullscreen Big Ocean work with AI audio specialists to help refine their performances.

The group synchronises by using specialised metronomes that flash in time with the music, vibrating smartwatches that pulse to the beat, and numeric displays that visually count measurements.\n\nWhen recording vocals, Big Ocean collaborates with AI specialists who track each member\u2019s vocal characteristics and then create a voice model that helps them refine their performances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative process,\u201d says PJ. \u201cWhen things get difficult, our staff support us, helping us adapt and overcome challenges together.\u201d\n\nTheir music focuses on the themes of perseverance, hope and unity. Their debut song, Glow, encourages listeners to \u201cdraw the world we\u2019ll create together in the sky\u201d.

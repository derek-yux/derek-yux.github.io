Discovery Upfront presentation in New York today, it was announced that Max, the company\u2019s premier streaming platform, will be rebranded HBO Max this summer.\n\nWBD\u2019s streaming business has incredible momentum, turning around its profitability by almost $3B in just two years and scaling globally with 22M subscribers added over the past year, with a clear path to over 150M+ by the end of 2026. This is thanks to an enormous amount of hard work, investment and re-focusing the strategy on the programming that is working best like HBO, recent box-office movies, docuseries, certain reality series, and Max and local originals, and de-prioritizing other genres that drive less engagement or acquisition.\n\nThis evolution has also been influenced by changing consumer needs, and the fact that no consumer today is saying they want more content, but most consumers are saying they want better content. With other services filling the more basic needs with volume, WBD has clearly distinguished itself through its quality and distinct stories, and no brand has done that better and more consistently over 50+ years than HBO.\n\nReturning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a testament to WBD\u2019s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach \u2013 leaning heavily on consumer data and insights \u2013 to best position itself for success.\n\nDavid Zaslav, President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said: \u201cThe powerful growth we have seen in our global streaming service is built around the quality of our programming. Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nDuring the WBD Upfront on stage at Madison Square Garden, JB Perrette, President and CEO of Streaming, and Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO of HBO and Max Content, provided further details on the upcoming change.\n\nPerrette: \u201cWe will continue to focus on what makes us unique \u2013 not everything for everyone in a household, but something distinct and great for adults and families. It\u2019s really not subjective, not even controversial \u2013 our programming just hits different.\u201d\n\nBloys: \u201cWith the course we are on and strong momentum we are enjoying, we believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition. And it clearly states our implicit promise to deliver content that is recognized as unique and, to steal a line we always said at HBO, worth paying for.\u201d\n\nHBO Max\u00ae is the premier global streaming platform from Warner Bros. Discovery that delivers the most unique and captivating stories, ranging from the highest quality in scripted programming, movies, documentaries, true crime, adult animation, and live sports and news (where available).

(Photo Credit: X)\n\nQuentin Tarantino is celebrated for his distinct filmmaking style, marked by sharp dialogue, stylised violence, and rich pop culture references. While Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds have become cult favourites, it was Reservoir Dogs, released in 1992, that first introduced audiences to his signature cinematic voice. However, few know the story behind what actually inspired the film.\n\nTarantino has openly said that Reservoir Dogs was heavily influenced by Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1956 film The Killing. In fact, Tarantino called The Killing one of the most important films in his early life. Kubrick\u2019s film is based on the novel Clean Break by Lionel White. The plot revolves around a robbery at a racetrack planned by a group of men. The crime drama stood out from others because of how it was told.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nThe film, instead of showing the story in a straight line, jumped back and forth in time. The same event was also shown from different points of view. This technique kept the audience guessing and gave it a unique style.\n\nTarantino talked about this influence in a 1992 interview with The Seattle Times. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t go out of my way to do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did think of it as my Killing, my take on that kind of heist movie.\" He also spoke at the Cannes premiere of Reservoir Dogs where he said, \u201cThe Killing is my favourite heist film, and I was definitely influenced by it.\"\n\nThe Killing was Kubrick\u2019s third film and his first big Hollywood project. Before this, he had made smaller films. The method of storytelling used in The Killing was not common at the time. It gave the film a fresh style that stood out in the 1950s. Years later, Tarantino used a similar technique in Reservoir Dogs, which also moved back and forth in time and focused on different characters\u2019 versions of events.\n\nReleased in 1992, Reservoir Dogs starred Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, Michael Madsen, Edward Bunker and Tarantino himself. They played a group of thieves involved in a diamond heist that goes horribly wrong. The film also featured Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks and Steven Wright in supporting roles.\n\nWhile the film drew attention for its violent scenes and strong language, it received positive reviews from critics, especially for the performances by the main cast.\n\nFirst Published: May 16, 2025, 16:39 IST\n Your goal is to keep the reader curious and guessing at what comes next at the end of each paragraph."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tarantino\u2019s Heist Film Influences: The Killing vs. Reservoir Dogs+++++\n\nQuentin Tarantino's Directorial Debut, Reservoir Dogs, Is Not Just A Masterclass In Dialogue And Stylized Violence\u2014It\u2019s Also A Love Letter To Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1956 Heist Film, The Killing.

Trump is in Saudi Arabia, standing alongside his new \u201chabibi\u201d, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (Emil Wakim). Trump is a big fan of everything Saudi Arabia has to offer: \u201cFrom the oil to the money to end of list.\u201d He also celebrates his visit to Qatar, where he was gifted a $400m plane, which he would much rather take than an American one: \u201cHave you seen our planes?

More sentimental than funny, although it never crosses over into treacle.\n\nOn a New York City morning news show, two of the regular hosts (Ashley Padilla and Kenan Thompson) announce that their third co-anchor is out on maternity leave. They welcome Johansson\u2019s substitute from nightly news, who tries to get in on their frothy delivery style by using puns for every story, no matter how inappropriate: \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having: a Queens couple dies in an apparent murder-suicide\u201d, \u201cHasta la Visa, baby \u2013 another infant has been deported.\u201d A couple decent lines, but it\u2019s too one-note.\n\nA new Please Don\u2019t Destroy video finds Ben, John and Martin down in the dumps over the state of the world.

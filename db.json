(Read our minute-by-minute recap.)\n\nMore from GoldDerby\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt the end of Tuesday's live finale, host Carson Daly announced that Adam was the winner, Jaelen was the runner-up, Renzo placed third, Lucia came in fourth, and Jadyn finished fifth. That made coach Michael a two-time champion in as many seasons, after prevailing with Sofronio Vasquez in Season 26.\n\nBy claiming victory, Adam broke the long-standing Instant Save curse, as he was previously saved by online support. (One prior winner, Season 22's Bryce Leatherwood, earned the Wild Card vote during his competition, but it wasn't technically the same twist as the Instant Save.)\n\nSEE\u2018The Voice\u2019 winners: All seasons\n\nJust one week ago, the Top 12 were cut down to the Top 5 on live television, and Adam placed in the middle part of those results, alongside Olivia Kuper Harris, Iris Herrera, and Bryson Battle. Viewers voted feverishly to keep Adam via The Voice App, which resulted in him becoming a finalist, while Olivia, Iris, and Bryson were all sent home.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdditionally, Adam is now the third winner in the history of NBC's reality TV show to only receive a single chair turn in the blind auditions. The other one-chair turns were Season 12's Chris Blue (Team Alicia Keys) and Season 17's Jake Hoot (Team Kelly Clarkson).\n\n\"I love you, man,\" Michael Bubl\u00e9 told Adam David just moments before the confetti fell during the finale. \"You're my kind of artist. I love you, and congratulations. I know you can do it.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. performed the following songs during the competition: \"Baby, I Love Your Way,\" \"Home,\" \"Unaware,\" \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"Bring It on Home to Me,\" \"Hard Fought Hallelujah,\" \"You Are So Beautiful\" (watch above) and \"The Weight\" (his coach duet).\n\nAdam also won Gold Derby's poll that asked fans who should win The Voice, with a leading 23.25 percent. He was followed by Jadyn at 21.8 percent, Renzo at 19.4 percent, Lucia at 19 percent, and Jaelen at 16.4 percent. Do you agree or disagree with the finale results?

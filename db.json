They kept their roster intact and pressed down the gas pedal, chasing a repeat and a 19th banner.\n\nThey won 61 games in the regular season and sailed through the first round of the playoffs in five games. The plan was, and is still, to win for the next six weeks -- and then address the business after another parade.\n\nBut the Celtics face an unexpectedly vital Game 3 on Saturday afternoon at Madison Square Garden, stunningly down 2-0 in their conference semifinal series with the New York Knicks.\n\nIf the Celtics can't pivot in this series -- especially reversing their untimely shooting slump that has seen them miss a whopping 75 3-pointers over the first two games in blowing back-to-back 20-point second-half leads -- their continued viability as a group will suddenly be in question.\n\nNo matter how this season played out, this group of champion Celtics faced an uncertain future because of how much it would cost to keep that team, masterfully constructed by team president Brad Stevens, intact.\n\nTHE CELTICS ARE being sold to a group led by investor Bill Chisholm at a valuation of more than $6 billion, a record-setting transaction that thrilled NBA power brokers and made everyone feel good about the health of the league.\n\nChisholm, a lifelong Celtics fan and Massachusetts native, has reportedly been forming a coalition to piece together the financing of the giant purchase.\n\nWhen it is settled, it seems clear that the Celtics, who were last sold for just $360 million more than 20 years ago, will have a massively more expensive mortgage to service.\n\nThe Celtics knew their present and future were tied to two-way wing stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, and they wanted to make sure the duo was locked into long-term contracts. That part of the planning was executed as planned. Brown signed in 2023 and then Tatum did the same in 2024 to deals that would keep them with the Celtics until the end of the decade at a combined cost of more than $600 million.\n\nDating back at least three years, as the new collective bargaining agreement between team owners and the players' association was taking shape, the Celtics identified 2025 as a pinch point.\n\nWe are weeks away from that point, no matter what happens on the court, because Tatum's new contract kicks in, and the Celtics will face being a so-called \"repeater\" luxury tax payer.\n\nThere is one pending free agent among the current Boston core: beloved veteran big man Al Horford, who is in the final season of his contract.

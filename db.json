(Read our minute-by-minute recap.)\n\nMore from GoldDerby\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt the end of Tuesday's live finale, host Carson Daly announced that Adam was the winner, Jaelen was the runner-up, Renzo placed third, Lucia came in fourth, and Jadyn finished fifth. That made coach Michael a two-time champion in as many seasons, after prevailing with Sofronio Vasquez in Season 26.\n\nBy claiming victory, Adam broke the long-standing Instant Save curse, as he was previously saved by online support. (One prior winner, Season 22's Bryce Leatherwood, earned the Wild Card vote during his competition, but it wasn't technically the same twist as the Instant Save.)\n\nSEE\u2018The Voice\u2019 winners: All seasons\n\nJust one week ago, the Top 12 were cut down to the Top 5 on live television, and Adam placed in the middle part of those results, alongside Olivia Kuper Harris, Iris Herrera, and Bryson Battle. Viewers voted feverishly to keep Adam via The Voice App, which resulted in him becoming a finalist, while Olivia, Iris, and Bryson were all sent home.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdditionally, Adam is now the third winner in the history of NBC's reality TV show to only receive a single chair turn in the blind auditions. The other one-chair turns were Season 12's Chris Blue (Team Alicia Keys) and Season 17's Jake Hoot (Team Kelly Clarkson).\n\n\"I love you, man,\" Michael Bubl\u00e9 told Adam David just moments before the confetti fell during the finale. \"You're my kind of artist. I love you, and congratulations. I know you can do it.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. performed the following songs during the competition: \"Baby, I Love Your Way,\" \"Home,\" \"Unaware,\" \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"Bring It on Home to Me,\" \"Hard Fought Hallelujah,\" \"You Are So Beautiful\" (watch above) and \"The Weight\" (his coach duet).\n\nAdam also won Gold Derby's poll that asked fans who should win The Voice, with a leading 23.25 percent. He was followed by Jadyn at 21.8 percent, Renzo at 19.4 percent, Lucia at 19 percent, and Jaelen at 16.4 percent. Do you agree or disagree with the finale results?

Professors warn a mass exodus of foreign students threatens to stifle the academic prowess of the institution even as it battles against the administration for its ideological autonomy.\n\nThe White House said Thursday that \u201cenrolling foreign students is a privilege, not a right\u201d and accused Harvard leadership of turning \u201ctheir once-great institution into a hot-bed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have repeatedly failed to take action to address the widespread problems negatively impacting American students and now they must face the consequences of their actions,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CNN.\n\nHarvard and Trump officials have been locked in conflict for months as the administration demands the university make changes to campus programming, policies, hiring and admissions to root out on-campus antisemitism and eliminate what it calls \u201cracist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 practices.\u201d The administration has homed in on foreign students and staff it believes participated in contentious campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBut the university\u2019s leadership argues many of the requests, including an \u201caudit\u201d of the \u201cviewpoint\u201d of its students and staff, go far beyond the role of the federal government and may violate Harvard\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nHarvard is among dozens of US universities facing similar demands from the Trump administration, but it has emerged as the fiercest defender of its academic independence.\n\nThe university swiftly condemned the SEVP revocation as \u201cunlawful,\u201d saying in a statement it is \u201cfully committed to maintaining Harvard\u2019s ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University \u2013 and this nation \u2013 immeasurably.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community.

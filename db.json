It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.\n\nThe Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called \"Infinity Saga\" \u2013 the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.\n\nThe key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\n\nThere's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in Worl"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Thunderbolts: Marvel's Delightful Mess of Misfits+++++**\n\nThe latest Marvel flick, **Thunderbolts**, has burst onto the scene, proving that sometimes being scrappy and \u201cdown-to-earth\u201d is the perfect recipe for superhero success. With **Florence Pugh** at the helm, expect shenanigans and dysfunctional fun that leave the audience giggling between gasps.+++++\n\nPost-**Avengers: Endgame**, it seems the superhero world has taken a couple of detours into quirky, uncharted territories\u2014kind of like your dad getting lost on a road trip.

Are we in for a wild ride or a bumpy trip?+++++\n\nUnlike its predecessors that dazzled with **indestructible titans**, **Thunderbolts** introduces a ragtag group of not-so-super spies floundering around like a toddler learning to walk. They\u2019re deemed too \u201cdangerous\u201d by their former employers, because who better to save the day than a bunch of sad-sack spies who can barely keep their lunch orders straight? It\u2019s like *The Bourne Identity*, but with less \"cool\" and more \"oops.\"+++++\n\nThe movie excels in showcasing the woes of its unlikely heroes: **Yelena** (Pugh), the Russian assassin with a flair for sarcasm; **Red Guardian** (David Harbour), the nostalgic dad-figure; and the **Winter Soldier** (Sebastian Stan), who\u2019s more angst-ridden than a teenager with a broken heart. Together, they tackle personal struggles while dodging bullets that are, shocker, actually lethal! What a novel concept in a superhero film!+++++\n\nWhile many fans have been let down by previous outings like **Eternals** and **The Marvels**, **Thunderbolts** teaches a pivotal lesson: it\u2019s not about the powers; it\u2019s about the characters.
